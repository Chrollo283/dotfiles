- This config is using FreeDesktop and a heavily modified version of the PowerArrow Theme
- I suggest using XFCE as a base to install AwesomeWM, as this config is looking for a number of standard XFCE programs to function correctly
- The compositor in use is Picom, the config for this is expected to be found in .config/picom/picom.conf

- Similar to my AwesomeWM config, a number of standard XFCE programs are required
- Top bar is Polybar, config for this is included
- Font used on Polybar is Ubuntu Regular
- The compositor in use is Picom, the config for this is expected to be found in .config/picom.conf
