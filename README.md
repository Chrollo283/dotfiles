# dotfiles
All of my Manjaro/AwesomeWM dotfiles.

## Testing

- There are some directories inside my .config folder that are just there for testing purposes only (such as microsoft-edge-dev).

## AwesomeWM

- My AwesomeWM config is using FreeDesktop and a modified version of the Powerarrow theme.
- I suggest using XFCE as a base to install AwesomeWM, as my config is looking for a number of XFCE default programs.
- As for the compositor, my config is expecting to see Picom and its config file at .config/picom/picom.conf

## Qutebrowser

- If you take a look at my Qutebrowser config.py you will see that the 'startpage' is a local file. This local directory has not been included in this commit, but I will upload at a later date once a few bugs and issues have been taken care of.

## Default programs

- Terminal Emulator:
	- Terminator
- Text Editors:
	- Doom Emacs
	- Vim
- File Manager:
	- Pcmanfm
- Image Editor:
	- Gimp
- Browsers:
	- Qutebrowser (main)
	- Brave Browser (backup)
- Screenshot Tool:

## IMPORTANT!

- There is some bugs in my AwesomeWM config, nothing system breaking but smaller things such as brightness keys not working on Laptops.
- I am figuring out the simplest solutions to these problems still and repo will be updated once fixes have been made.
